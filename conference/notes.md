# Notes on Conference Presentation

As part of this project, we presented our work on **3D Printing and Chaos Theory** at the **Montgomery College STEM Student Research Conference** on **May 19**.

The presentation highlighted:

- The physical modeling of chaotic systems (Double Pendulum, Malkus Waterwheel)
- The challenges of printing complex attractors
- The intersection of physics, mathematics, and digital fabrication

The photo included in this folder shows us presenting our project at the event.
