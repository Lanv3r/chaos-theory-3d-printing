# Notes on 3D Printed Malkus Waterwheel

The Malkus Waterwheel is a physical analog of the Lorenz system and a striking example of chaotic motion in a mechanical form. This 3D printed version was designed to demonstrate how simple, deterministic systems can still behave unpredictably over time.

## Design Overview

This model was created in **Fusion 360** and printed using **PETG filament** for strength and water resistance.

### Printed Parts:

- `Base.stl` – The bottom support platform  
- `Upper Arm.stl` (×2) – Vertical supports to hold the axle in place  
- `Waterwheel.stl` (×2) – The side wheels of the rotating assembly  
- `Big Bar.stl` (×1) – Connects the two wheels  
- `Bar.stl` (×8) – Small arms that span between the wheels  
- `Bucket.stl` (×8) – Cylindrical containers that hold and release water

### Assembly Notes:

- Use **two R6-2RS ball bearings**:  
  - **Inner Diameter:** 3/8"  
  - **Outer Diameter:** 7/8"  
  - **Width:** 9/32"
- Attach the **Upper Arms** to the **Base** using screws (holes are included).
- Insert the **Bars** between the two Waterwheels, then attach the Buckets to the Bars using friction or adhesive.
- The completed waterwheel should spin freely with minimal friction.

## Functional Tips

- **Hole in Bucket:**  
  Each bucket has a small hole at the bottom to let water drain. You can **adjust the hole size** to change the wheel’s behavior. Smaller holes drain more slowly, affecting the timing of the wheel’s movement.
  
- **Water Input Rate:**  
  The amount and rate of water being added to the top of the wheel strongly influences whether the behavior is regular, periodic, or chaotic.

- **Low Friction is Critical:**  
  Ensure bearings are aligned well and that moving parts spin freely. Friction dampens the motion and can stop the chaotic behavior from emerging.

## Performance

The final model worked well and demonstrated chaotic motion clearly. The wheel regularly changed direction, spun unpredictably, and never settled into a fixed pattern—visually demonstrating the chaotic dynamics described by Edward Lorenz.

The behavior continued long after the video clip ended—showing that even a simple system can behave unpredictably for extended periods.
