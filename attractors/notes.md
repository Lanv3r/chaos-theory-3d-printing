# Notes on Printing Chaotic Attractors

This part of the project aimed to 3D print physical representations of chaotic attractors, such as the **Lorenz attractor** and **Rössler attractor**. These complex 3D curves are known for their intricate, spiraling structures that visualize deterministic chaos in dynamical systems.

## Attempt 1: PETG with Supports

- **Result:** ❌ Unsuccessful
- **Problem:** The attractor's curves were too thin and intricate.
- **Outcome:** Prints came out messy, and removing the support material was extremely difficult due to the dense, overlapping structure. Many parts broke or fused unintentionally during cleanup.

## Attempt 2: Dual Extrusion with PVA Supports

- **Result:** ❌ Failed
- **Problem:** PVA didn't print reliably.
- **Outcome:** The print failed to complete and resulted in a messy structure. Even when partial prints were done, the PVA didn’t fully dissolve in water, leaving behind a gummy residue.

## Reflections

While these models are visually stunning in digital form, they proved very difficult to realize physically—especially at small scales and with filament-based (FDM) 3D printing. The geometry of chaotic attractors demands high-resolution, support-friendly techniques—possibly resin printing or SLS may work better in future attempts.

Despite the failures, this part of the project was a valuable lesson in the limitations of certain materials and technologies when applied to mathematically complex forms.
